I am currently studying Software Development at CodeSpace Academy. I have also completed many courses on Udemy and plan to continue expanding my knowledge through learning and practical application.

I earned my B.A. in Communication Science with a focus on Media Studies and Journalism in 2015 from the University of the Free State. After university, I worked in the fruit industry and also taught English as a foreign language.

I am ready for a challenge and eager to prove myself. I am seeking experience in the software development industry and believe that I would be an asset to any business because I am willing to go above and beyond. I believe life is about experiences, and I want to gain as much as possible while learning everything I can. I strongly feel that my work becomes the center of my life, and therefore, I am looking for a challenge that will allow me to define myself within it.
